Game description
-----------------

There are basically two types of cards in DOBBLE. One in the "middle" and one "on hand". Each card has 8 symbols, of which exactly one can always be found on any other card. The purpose of the game is to find the only symbol that can be found on both the hand and the middle card as quickly as possible.

DOBBLE is usually played with several people. To make it exciting for single players, I have installed a time limit (e.g. 60 seconds) within which as many symbol matches as possible must be found. The result is saved as a high score.

Game round
----------
When you click on “Runde starten” two random cards are displayed and the countdown begins. If a match has been found, the symbol in the lower area must be clicked. If it is correct, the counter goes up and two new cards are dealt. If you click incorrectly, there is a time penalty (e.g. 1.3 seconds) during which no symbol can be selected. After the time has elapsed, a message will be displayed asking whether the high score has been cracked.
